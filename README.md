# NestJS Task Management
A full-stack project created to allow users to manage their tasks by creating their own accounts and storing their tasks and task statuses.

## Motivation
I decided that I wanted to learn NestJS to dive deeper into building scalable and secure server-side applications. I referenced Ariel Weinberger's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-zero-to-hero/) to help me along the way. The API authorizes users to sign-up/sing-in, and they can add and remove tasks, update task status and search/filter tasks.

## Technologies
* TypeScript
* NestJS
* Node.js
